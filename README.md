# Down-for-Everyone-or-Just-Me
Have you ever tried to access a website but it does not loads???😭

And you wondered "Is it just me can't access the website?"

Well, I have created this useless project to answer that question.😏

Introducing...

# Down for Everyone or Just Me?

Then I answered "I need to do this for the sake of useless things!"

# So, how to use it?
**Easy! Just run the .exe file!**
